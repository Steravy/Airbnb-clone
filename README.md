# Airbnb Clone

This repository is an Airbnb clone built with Next.js, a powerful React.js framework. The project aims to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb, providing a platform for users to authenticate, browse property, search and filter places, make bookings, reservations, add to favorites, and properties for the owners. But the main goal was to built something challenging in order to sharp my skills and gain new ones.
